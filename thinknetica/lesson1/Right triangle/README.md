# Right triangle

>The program requests from the user 3 sides of the triangle and determines whether the triangle is rectangular, using the Pythagorean theorem and displays the result on the screen. In addition, if the triangle is isosceles (any two sides are equal), information is added that the triangle is also isosceles. If all 3 sides are equal, then the triangle is isosceles and equilateral, but not rectangular.
